                <h2>Helpful Tips</h2>
                <h3>Get Organized:</h3>
                <p>Organization is the key to good meal prep and a successful plan. Keeping a clean area to work,
                    space in the refrigerator and a shopping list will make your time in the kitchen a breeze. Know
                    ahead of time what you have on hand for your prep.</p>
                <h3>Invest In Some Quality Storage Containers:</h3>
                <p>Food Storage is an essential part of meal prep. Itâ€™s worth it to invest into matching containers.
                    Glass containers are a nice option. They are eco-friendly and microwave safe.</p>
                <h3>Maximize Multitasking:</h3>
                <p>While roasting some vegetables and/or proteins in the oven, you can also chop/wash all your herbs and
                    other raw
                    vegetables. Prepare a few sauces ahead of time to keep ready for the week. If you are making soup
                    and have extra, freeze for an easy heated meal later on in the week. The more you get going at once,
                    the faster the prep.</p>
                <h3>Add Spices To Your Meals:</h3>
                <p>After you prep your ingredients and are ready to assemble the recipes, add some spice to switch it up
                    during the week. Some tried and true spices are; paprika, salt, pepper, dill, chili powder, basil,
                    and thyme.</p>
                <h3>Know That You Can Do It:</h3>
                <p>It may seem overwhelming to do a large batch of cooking all at once, but think of the time and
                    freedom you will have over the week. You will also save money, eat heathy and try new foods. The
                    best tip is to take these new recipes and
                    JUST START.</p>
